                   <p>Rhinoceros beetles are herbivorous insects named for the horn-like projections on and around the males' heads. Most are black, gray, or greenish in color, and some are covered in soft hairs. Another name given to some of these insects is the Hercules beetle, because they possess a strength of Herculean proportion. Adults of some species can lift objects 30 times their own weight without sacrificing any speed (that would be equivalent to a human having no problem carrying an adult male white rhinoceros). Some can even lift up to 100 times their own weight, though they have trouble moving at that point. Male beetles use this extreme strength to fight off other males and win the right to mate with females. Rhinoceros beetles can grow up to six inches (15 centimeters), making them some of the largest beetles in the world.</p>
