                   <p>koala, (Phascolarctos cinereus), also called koala bear, tree-dwelling marsupial of coastal eastern and southern Australia classified in the family Phascolarctidae (suborder Vombatiformes).

The koala is about 60 to 85 cm (24 to 33 inches) long and weighs up to 14 kg (31 pounds) in the southern part of its range (Victoria and South Australia) but only about half that in subtropical Queensland to the north. Virtually tailless, the body is stout and gray, with a pale yellow or cream-coloured chest and mottling on the rump. The broad face has a wide, rounded, leathery nose, small yellow eyes, and big fluffy ears. The feet are strong and clawed; the two inner digits of the front feet and the innermost digit of the hind feet are opposable for grasping. Because of the animalâ€™s superficial resemblance to a small bear, the koala is sometimes called, albeit erroneously, the koala bear.
